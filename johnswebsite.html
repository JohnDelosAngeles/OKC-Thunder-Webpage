          With the departure of Josh Giddey, and replacing him woth two low
          usage players in Alex Caruso and Isaiah Hartenstein, their will be
          plenty more shots to go around OKC. Shai especially will look to get
          more shots and improve as a playmaker as well with the addition of a
          second skilled big man in Hartenstein.

          Alex Caruso fits like a glove on this OKC team, he was first in steal
          rate right ahead of his now teammate Shai Gilgeous Alexander.
          Defensively he is one of the best one one one wing defenders in the
          league, so replacing him wiht Giddey will help the defense out a lot.
          Offensively, he will space the floor and provide smart decision
          making, and terciary shot creation and playmaking. Overall, it is safe
          to say OKC will be turning teams over at a historic rate next season.

          I do expect Lu Dort to play slightly fewer minutes this season with
          the addition of Alex Caruso. He will still be a foundational piece to
          OKC rotation.

          I certainly do expect Jalen Williams to take a leap this year. He had
          a disappointing playoff series against Dallas last year and I am sure
          he was to come back with avengence this year. He will take a large
          amount of the shots available from trading Giddey.

          Chet Holmgren was the defensive anchor for this team last season. I it
          very relieving to know that we now have a solid backup who can offer a
          similar level of impact on defense if Chet cannot play 100 consecutive
          games this year which it is very likely that he will not. One area I
          am really hoping that he improves on this season is taking more
          threes.

          The biggest FA signing in Thunder history, signed when we needed him
          the most. He is one of my favorite thunder players, I am very excited
          to see how his screens can get Shai open, as well as how well he can
          develop a pNr game with Shai.

          One of my favorite players on this team. Extremely smart, versitile,
          and efficient two way player. I am hoping that he can also improve his
          3 point shooting alongside Chet. It will give this team a lot more
          firepower.

          Isaiah Joe, the one high volume sniper on this team. He is so
          important to the spacing of this team, I expect another solid year out
          of him.

          Aaron Wiggins broke out last season and got more and more minutes as
          the season went on. I would love so see him take more shots as he is
          one of the most effient role players in the league.
